# who-pay-what

Awesome app to **split your home bills into proportionnal salary-related amounts**.

It's based on **equity** and not equality.

Enter your household's financial resources, then the bill amount that you want to split up and hit go!

**For example** : the first person receives 1500€, the second person receives 500€, your bill amount is 900€.
The gap between the two wages is 3 so the first person will pay 3 times more than the other.

The first person will pay 675€ and the second 225€.
675 + 225 = 900
225 x 3 = 675
